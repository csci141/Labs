The goal of this project is to gain more practice with using functions, lists and dictionaries and gain some intuition for Machine Learning, the field of computer science concerned with writing algorithms that allow computes to "learn" from data.

The problem we'll be solving is as follows: Given a data file containing hundreds of patient records with values describing measurements of cancer tumors and whether or not each tumor is malignant or benign, develop a simple rule-based classifier that can be used to predict whether an as-yet-unseen tumor is malignant or benign.

The general idea is that malignant tumors are different than benign tumors. Malignant tumors tend to have larger radii, to be more smooth, to be more symmetric, etc. Measurements have been taken on many tumors whose class (malignant or benign) is known. The code you are going to write will get the average score across all the malignant tumors for an attribute (e.g. 'area') as well as the average score for that attribute for benign tumors. Let’s say that the average area for malignant tumors is 100, and for benign tumors is 50. We can then use that information to try to predict whether a given tumor is malignant or benign.

Imagine you are presented with a new tumor and told the area was 99. All else being equal, we would have reason to think this tumor is more likely to be malignant than had its area been 51. Based on this intuition, we are going to create a simple classification scheme. We will calculate the midpoint between the malignant average and the benign average (75 in our hypothetical example), and simply say that for each new tumor, if its value for that attribute is greater than or equal to the midpoint value for that attribute, that is one vote for the tumor being malignant. Each attribute that we are using produces a vote, and at the end of counting votes for each attribute, if the malignant votes are greater than or equal to the benign votes, we predict that the tumor is malignant.
