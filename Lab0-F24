\section*{Purpose}
The purpose of this lab is meant to introduce you to the tools we'll be using this quarter. If you have questions, be sure to ask the TA. Labs are your opportunity to get personalized help!

\section*{Collaboration in Lab}
You are encouraged to work together with your peers in completing the
labs; you can discuss problems with a lab partner. In lab, you are allowed to look at other
students' code and discuss solutions with your peers. \textbf{However, the
Python submission that you upload to Canvas must be your own. Don't copy and paste or type exactly what you see on another student's screen.}
