### CSCI 141
## Fall 2024
## Lab 2: Introduction to Python and the Thony IDE

# Introduction and preliminaries
The purpose of this lab is meant to introduce you to Python and Thonny. Lecture this week talks about what programming is about and shows a few examples of very short Python programs. In this lab, you’ll get your computer set up for this quarter, and get and introduction to writing and running your own Python program.
Since there’s a wide variety of backgrounds in this class, everyone will progress at different speeds through this lab - that’s ok! You should have enough time to complete this lab during the lab session. If you do not, be sure to upload your submission to Canvas by the due date. If you have questions, be sure to ask the TA. Ask questions often. Labs are your opportunity to get personalized help!

# Log into you the lab computers
The CS labs have been upgraded recently! Read about your account and files storage here: [[https://support.cs.wwu.edu/home/survival_guide/day_to_day/Accounts_Passwords_and_Profile_Storage.html]] . If you have registered for the class fewer than 24 hours ago, talk to your TA about getting access for the day. All the labs assigned for CSCI 141 boot into Linux - learning to use it is a course goal so take the time to dive in! You can find a user guide here: [[https://help.ubuntu.com/stable/ubuntu-help/]].

# Notation
In our class materials, we'll often give instructions about what Python code to use. This could show up 'in line' like this: `print("Hello World!")` or it may be displayed in a code block, like this: 
```
  def print_hello():
  print("Hello World!")
```
